  <h2>About me</h2>
  <div>
    <p>I grew up in a family of seven in rural Northern California. After a handful of years working at a grocery store after high school, I moved across the country and back then I put myself through college. A decade later I became a homeowner, and fairly recently I became a mother of a now 3-year old. I'm a longtime vegan living in Portland, Oregon, with my husband and kiddo, working remotely as the exectutive assistant of an upscale exterior design firm based out of San Francisco. Over the years I have worked in many non-career positions over the last decade, including non-profits, small businesses, and grocery cooperatives. One reason I decided to take a programming class is because I'd love to have an actual career someday, and one that I enjoy. The problem-solving aspect of coding sounds fun to me, as well as the "in the zone" working potential. It's been a challenge finding the time and brain space for this class, and as a full time mom the struggle is real, but I am enjoying this new world of learning and already feel that I'd like to return to Epicodus in the fututre.
