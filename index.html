  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>I grew up in a rural Northern California town, and put myself through college, managed to become a homeowner, and fairly recently became a mother of a now 3-year old. I live in Portland, Oregon, with my husband and kiddo, working remotely as the exectutive assistant of an upscale exterior design firm based out of San Francisco. 
    I'm always working, parenting, or tackling a home improvement project.
    I have a BS in Botany from Cal Poly Humboldt, have worked in many non-career positions over the last decade, including non-profits, small businesses, and grocery cooperatives.
    One reason I decided to take a class on programming is because I'd love to have an actual career. I also think I'd really enjoy the problem-solving aspect, and the "in the zone" working potential of programming. It's been a challenge fiding the time and brain space for this class, but I do like it and feel like I'll explore it further in the future.
